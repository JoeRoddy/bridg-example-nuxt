# Bridg - Nuxt / Vue

I am not a Vue developer, if I did something stupid with this example, feel free to open a PR.

### Up and Running

1. `git clone https://github.com/JoeRoddy/bridg-example-nuxt` and cd into directory
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

Note: The Bridg client generator script throws an error during compilation, this is specific to this project. The Bridg client still works just fine.

### Learning

- Open `/components/tutorial.vue` to start modifying your query, your prisma client should work exactly as it would on the server
